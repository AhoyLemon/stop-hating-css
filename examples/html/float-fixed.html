      <p>This is like watching two monkeys at the puberty zoo. Here’s a bunch of numbers. They may look random but they’re my phone number. Do you think horses get songs stuck in their heads? Detention is no big deal. Don’t have a crap attack. I’ll wave at you every day. If I drunk text you and you’re asleep, don’t text me in the morning…that ship has sailed. Sausage leather belts. Yeah it’s an acquired taste. That I just acquired.</p>
