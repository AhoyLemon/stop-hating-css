# Lemon's Talk Template

## What's this?

Basically, I've built a number of talks using the same general technology stack, so this is a boilerplate for those conventions

Like 95% of the this repo is actually [Hakim El Hattib](https://github.com/hakimel)'s [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) framework, so he deserves most of the credit here.

There were some style things I found missing in a default reveal.js install, and wanted some quality of life from pug partials, so that's what this accomplishes.


## How do I use this?

1. Download/unzip this project and serve it locally via [Prepros](https://prepros.io).
2. Now just make whatever changes you like to `pug\index.pug`
3. Need to change the Reveal configuration? Edit `js\reveal-config.js`
